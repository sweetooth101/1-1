		<h2>Interview with the Vampire</h2>
		<div>
            <p>Interview with the Vampire is a gothic horror and vampire novel by American author Anne Rice, 
				published in 1976. It was her debut novel. Based on a short story Rice wrote around 1968, 
				the novel centers on vampire Louis de Pointe du Lac, who tells the story of his life to a 
				reporter. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="hide">
           		 	<p>Rice composed the novel shortly after the death of her young daughter Michelle, 
				who served as an inspiration for the child-vampire character Claudia. Though initially the 
				subject of mixed critical reception, the book was followed by many widely popular sequels, 
				collectively known as The Vampire Chronicles. A film adaptation was released in 1994, starring 
				Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt, and a television series premiered in 2022. The novel has also been adapted 
				as a comic three times.</p>

		<h2>The Queen of the Demaned</h2>
		<div>
            			<p>The Queen of the Damned deals with the origins of vampires themselves. The mother of all vampires, Akasha, 
				begins as a pre-Egyptian queen, in a land called Kemet (which will become Egypt), many thousands of years 
				ago. During this time two powerful witches (Maharet and Mekare) live in the mountains close to Nineveh. The 
				witches are able to communicate with invisible spirits and gain simple favors from them. During this period 
				there is a bloodthirsty, invisible spirit known as Amel who continually asks the two witches if they need 
				his assistance, although they prudently decline the offer. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="hide">
			<p>The witches' village is destroyed and they are 
				incarcerated by the king and queen, who desire their knowledge. When the witches offend Akasha, the queen 
				condemns the twins. Enkil then orders his chief steward (who is Khayman as a mortal man) to rape the twins 
				in his stead, which would prove their lack of power, before the eyes of the court. Afterward the witches are 
				cast out into the desert. While making her way back home with a pregnant Maharet, Mekare curses the king 
				and queen secretly with Amel. Eventually Amel inflicts such torment on Akasha and Enkil that they demand 
				advice and help from the two witches.</p>
